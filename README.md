## Introduction
labodock_binder is an enhanced iteration of Labodock (https://github.com/RyanZR/labodock), with a primary focus on improved accessibility and user-friendliness. Notable modifications from Labodock version 2.0.0 include:

**Seamless Access**: Unlike the original Google Colab login requirement, labodock_binder allows free access from Chrome, Firefox, and Safari, without the need for signup or login. This is made possible through the implementation of Binder technology (https://mybinder.org/).

**Pre-built Images**: The labodock_binder image is pre-built. When a user clicks the link, the image is pulled from the cloud to the local browser, instead of installing all packages from scratch. This significantly accelerates the readiness for docking.

**Simplified Execution**: labodock_binder streamlines the process with one-click execution, eliminating the need for repetitive variable modifications.

These enhancements collectively contribute to a more user-friendly and accessible experience. labodock_binder emerges as a versatile and convenient tool for users worldwide, requiring only internet availabilityâ€”no Google account necessary.

## Usage
**PDB_ID** is a four-letter code from the PDB bank website, for example, 3HTB

**Native_lig** below means the native ligand of the co-crystal structure of the PDB bank, it can be found on the PDB website, it should always be a three-letter code, for example, JZ4

**smiles** is the small molecule you want to dock, you can obtain this from ChemDraw, from **Edit** > **Copy as smiles**

(In wedock2.ipynb, **smiles** variable was replaced by a CSV file containing multiple smiles)

The first three cells are the only thing you should modify. From the top left, click **Run** > **Run All Cells**, and the docking will start automatically. Your docked 3D interaction diagram will be at the bottom of the notebook.

**wedock.ipynb does not need any manual intervention, but for wedock2.ipynb, if you wish to overlay two docked small molecules, you do need to specify several variables manually.**
