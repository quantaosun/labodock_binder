## This is an example of using 7L10 (a downloaded local file) to show how to make an interaction (3D) diagram

## This notebook solved two problems,  

1. Local docking with local combined1.pdb instead of RCSB structures.
2. Generate the native ligand (in this case XEY) interaction instead of the docked ligand

Throughout this procedure, we use ```c1ccccc1``` severing as a ligand, molecule, and it does not matter,  no matter what is used, it will not be displayed at last
