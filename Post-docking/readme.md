### Never take docking result as something true, until other evidence is present.

We all know docking is slightly better than guessing in terms of correctly ranking the poses, to address this issue, the post-docking pose evaluation based on advanced molecular dynamics is preffered

This notebook provides an example of how such a process could be done via a simulation called binding pose metadynamic. there are two such packages, 

 1) the Schrodinger Binding pose metadynamics (BPMD).
 2) A similar open-sourced BPMD. This repository relies on the second one since it is open-sourced and has the maximum exposure to everyone.
